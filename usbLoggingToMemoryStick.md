#logging to a usb memory stick with a vdip1.

##### USB Logging to Memory Stick #####



USB logging to a memory stick is necessary for logging track and autocross runs as a laptop wouldn't be practical.  Logging is enabled by a VDIP1 device ([vdip1](http://apple.clickandbuild.com/cnb/shop/ftdichip?op=catalogue-products-null&prodCategoryID=53&title=VDIP1)).  Unfortunately I have not had success in getting this to work yet and believe that I received a defective unit.  Another is on order and once code is written it will be posted.  Expect it to be based on the usb to computer logging setup.
